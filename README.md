[] TODO: Use LEMG stack (Linux, Nginx, Mysql, Go)
> NOTE: Replacing PHP in LEMP stack
[] TODO: Use a server-side script instead of manually creating a list of all blog posts in the "index.html" file to automatically generate the list based on the files in the directory. This will save time and reduce the chance of errors when adding new blog posts.
[] TODO: Use a database: If you have a large number of blog posts, it's best to store the data in a database such as MySQL instead of individual files. This will make it easier to query and manage the data, and improve the performance of your website.
